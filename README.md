# All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List 2.8

## Important News

***(as of November 13th, 2019)
Version 2.8 is now out.***

*After much consideration I've decided that version 2.8 is the last version I'll create.*

*Meaning no more commits and it is no longer actively maintained. I apologise for the sudden halt of activity.*

*This is because I was disappointed by the outcomes from using the list and the performance impacts.
Another factor was the PowerShell script generator I have created and used is now cumbersome, slow and inefficient.*

I'm currently working on a related project that offers a detailed tutorial and a consolidated, ordered and deduplicated blocked hosts list for use in a DNS Sinkhole Server with an encrypted forwarder link.

Using this method should allow users to not use adblockers at all in browsers (a nice performance boost).
The DNS Sinkhole Server would also be network-wide and essentially act as a Pi-Hole device/service alternative **without the need to buy and use a Pi-Hole device on a Windows network**.

_More development is needed on my end for this before I release it publicly. Any work will appear in my **GitHub repos**._

## Description

This is an all-in-one adblocking filter list that thoroughly blocks trackers, popup ads, ads, unwanted cookies, fake news,
cookie warning messages, unwanted comment sections, crypto-coin mining, YouTube clutter, Twitter guff and social network hassles.

It's been tested in uBlock Origin for Chrome, Firefox and Edge; it should work just
fine in any decent adblocker that supports Adblock Plus 2.0 formatted lists.

It includes customized entries that block particularly annoying page elements.
It is saved in UTF-8 format.

**(VITAL:)**
Be sure to disable any lists that appear in the list below that you already have active in
the settings/dashboard. e.g. <https://i.imgur.com/cVyxL7J.png>

This list is very comprehensive and includes around 100 custom-picked adblocking filter lists.
As a basic rule this list includes filter lists that are obtainable at time of generation.

This list focuses on a "distrust website first" basis with an expected whitelisting on the users end
for approved websites.

## Usage

In your adblocker's filter lists section add either the URL:

<https://bit.ly/AIO-adblock>

_OR_

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/master/deanoman-adblocklist.txt>

Check the wiki for step-by-step instructions: <https://github.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/wiki>

## What's in Version 2.8

Version 2.8 of the AIO list is more complete and potent than ever.

* Added more adblocking lists (over 120 in total now)
* Tested browsers: Firefox, Vivaldi, Opera and Chrome
* Tested addons/extensions: uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus

All the above combined down to a simplified list.

## Credits

Full credit for the actual blocking ability goes to original list creators and maintainers. Thanks so much for their tireless work! :D
